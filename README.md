# 📊 Regression Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates **Regression Analysis** — a core concept in Machine Learning and Data Science used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores how regression models can be used to predict continuous outcomes based on given input data.  
It includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Visualization of relationships between features  
- Model training using regression algorithms  
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – for regression models and metrics

📈 Models Implemented (examples)
Depending on your notebook content, you may include:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Ridge / Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

(Update this section based on your notebook contents.)

🧩 Results Summary
Summarize your findings, e.g.:

The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.87, indicating strong correlation between the input variables and the target output. Further tuning with Ridge Regression slightly improved model stability.
